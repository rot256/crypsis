# Symmetric crypto
- Automate "OTP multiuse" decryption (medium)
- Extension attack on SHA1, SHA2 famalies (+MD5?)

# Asymmetric crypto

## RSA
- Parity oracle message recovery (mostly for fun)
- Forge public key matching a signature (medium)
- Attack against RSA with two primes choosen within short distance (easy)

# Other
- Unpacking of diffrent formats (possibly with dependencies)
